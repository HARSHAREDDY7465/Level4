"Convert my existing editable subgrid built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS into a fully functional PowerApps Component Framework (PCF) component. Ensure the following:

Preserve all existing features and behaviors from the current web resource implementation, including:

Inline editing of rows and columns.
Validation logic for edited fields.
Dynamic addition and deletion of rows.
Styling and responsiveness as per the current CSS.
Any custom events or business logic currently implemented in JavaScript.
PCF Requirements:

Use the latest PCF standards and best practices.
Implement the component using TypeScript.
Include manifest file (ControlManifest.Input.xml) with proper property definitions.
Support binding to dataset for model-driven apps.
Handle context updates and re-rendering efficiently.
Ensure accessibility and cross-browser compatibility.
Additional Considerations:

Maintain modular structure for easy maintenance.
Include comments explaining key sections.
Provide instructions for packaging and deploying the PCF component.
Ensure compatibility with Dataverse and Dynamics 365 environments.
Output:

Complete PCF project structure with all required files (index.ts, ControlManifest.Input.xml, CSS, resources).
Code should be production-ready and optimized for performance."**
